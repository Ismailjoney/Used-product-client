                            WE LIVE OUR MATERIAL CYCLE
                            Quality and durability – two requirements in the construction industry that Lindner represents for more than 55 years. In the wake of the climate crisis and advancing environmental pollution, the topics of sustainability and the circular economy have also become increasingly important in the construction industry. Lindner is also a pioneer in this area: Sustainability and environmental protection have been firmly established in our corporate culture since 1993: From being a founding member of the DGNB and drawing up our first own life cycle assessment in 2011 to the development of recyclable system products with corresponding CRADLE TO CRADLE CERTIFIED®awards and detailed environmental product declarations as the basis for green buildings.
 
                            "How to improve a perfect product? Reuse it!" – that was our first thought while developing our product range into ReUsed Products. ReUsed stands for building materials or products that are designed from beginning to be kept in closed cycles as far as possible – and can ideally be used in a 1:1 reuse. In the same way, we also offer to take back used products, such as our calcium sulphate floor panels, in the sense of reuse. These are then processed in our factory and resold as used products of equal value. In the same way, we take care of the professional disposal or recycling at the end of the use phase.
